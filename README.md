## Objective

- [x] You are tasked to build a web application whose purpose is to allow the user to manage a list of name value pairs.You are the following feature user stories with their acceptance criteria defined:

## User Stories

- [x] As a user I want to add a key/value pair to the list so I can build up my list.

  - Key/value pairs must be in the format `<key>=<value>`.
  - Keys and value can only contain `alpha-numeric` characters.
  - The equal sign is used to `delimit` the pair.
  - Spaces before and after the equal sign should be `ignored`.

- [x] As a user I want to remove a `key/value` pair from the list so I can remove ones I don't want anymore.

  - One key/value pair can be deleted at a time

- [x] As a user I want to `clear` the key/value list so I can start over with an empty list.

  - This `resets` the entire list to empty
  - `Clears` the textbox as well

- [x] As a user I want to save my list to an xml file so I can use it in another application.

  - Generate and start the `xml file download`
  - Any reasonable xml format will suffice

- [x] As a user I want to sort the list by key so I can get a better look at the data.

  - `Alphabetical` order on the `key`

- [x] As a user I want to sort the list by value so I can get a better look at the data.
  - `Alphabetical` order on the `value`
